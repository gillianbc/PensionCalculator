# Exercise in Modelling Pension Withdrawal for UK
See it in action here:

- Does someone need to wait until state pension is due or do they have enough now to retire early without running out of money?
- How much will they be able to safely spend each year?
- Is it better to take a 25% tax free lump sum?  
- Is it better to use up savings first and leave pension untouched?
- Is it better to use pensions first and leave savings untouched?
- Is it better to drawdown from pension, but no more than the income tax threshold (currently 12570), plus spend some from savings?
- Is it better to drawdown from pension within basic rate threshold (currently 37700) - surplus becomes savings?
- Even when you have no income and drawing from pension, you're allowed to pay in 3600 gross (2,880 from savings, 720 tax rebate) if you are under 75 (no rebate after that).  Is it worth it?
- What will be the long-term effects if I need a few adhoc withdrawals e.g. for a new car, a major repair, a new bathroom, an expensive holiday
- What effect will different growth rates have?

All these questions can be modelled by this app.

## What about inflation?
The interest on pension funds is assumed to by 4% above inflation.  The interest on savings is assumed to be 0, but no inflation either.  
So the figures are a rough approximation in today's money after taking inflation into account. 

TODO
----
Since I can put savings into Stocks and Shares ISA, which I expect to perform better than inflation, i.e. comparable with SIPP, I should configure an interest rate on the amount that is in my ISA savings.  I can only add Â£20000 per year to ISA.
